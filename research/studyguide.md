Based on the **Humanist Modernism Style Guide**, here is a breakdown of the style’s key
characteristics, what defines its authenticity, and how it specifically diverges from its ancestor,
Swiss Design.

### 1. Key Characteristics

The guide defines Humanist Modernism as a design language that marries structure with empathy.

- **Typography is Paramount:**
  - **Typeface Selection:** Rejects geometric (Futura) and grotesque (Helvetica) fonts in favor of
    **Humanist Sans-serifs** (Frutiger, Open Sans, Avenir) or **Old-style Serifs** (Garamond,
    Georgia). These fonts have varied stroke widths and open apertures, making them easier to
    distinguish.
  - **Generous Sizing:** Body text is significantly larger than standard web defaults (18–21px).
  - **Spacing:** Line height is loose (1.6–1.8) to reduce eye strain, and paragraph spacing is ample
    (1.5em).
  - **Measure:** Line length is strictly controlled (60–75 characters) to ensure the eye doesn't get
    lost moving from line to line.

- **Warm & Natural Palette:**
  - Avoids high-contrast "pure black on pure white" (#000 on #FFF), opting instead for **Off-Black
    (#333) on Warm White (#FAFAFA)**.
  - Uses earth tones, muted blues/greens, and sophisticated neutrals rather than neon or primary
    colors.

- **Content-First Layouts:**
  - Prefers single-column layouts for long-form reading.
  - Uses wide side margins (10–15% of viewport) to center focus.
  - Utilizes frequent subheadings, pull quotes, and lists to break up "walls of text."

### 2. What Makes It Authentic?

Authenticity in Humanist Modernism is measured by **empathy** rather than geometric perfection. A
design is only "authentic" if it prioritizes the human cognitive experience.

- **The "Grandmother Test":** It is not enough to be "clean"; it must be accessible. If the text is
  too small (16px or lower) or the contrast is too harsh, it fails the authenticity check regardless
  of how "modern" it looks.
- **Function Over Form:** Unlike early Modernism, which might sacrifice legibility for a perfect
  grid, Humanist Modernism asks, "Does this serve the reader?" If a decorative element hurts
  readability, it is removed.
- **Accessibility as a Core Tenet:** It integrates Universal Design principles (WCAG AAA compliance)
  as a starting point, not an afterthought.
- **Calligraphic Roots:** Authentic implementations use typefaces that feel "human-made"
  (calligraphic influence) rather than "machine-made" (geometric circles and straight lines).

### 3. Differentiation: Swiss Design vs. Humanist Modernism

While Humanist Modernism is a descendant of Swiss Design, it fundamentally alters the philosophy
from **Objectivity** to **Empathy**.

| Feature                   | Swiss Design (The Ancestor)                                     | Humanist Modernism (The Evolution)                                 |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional Temperature** | **Cold & Objective.** It seeks neutrality and anonymity.        | **Warm & Empathetic.** It seeks connection and comfort.            |
| **Typography**            | **Helvetica/Grotesque.** Neutral, uniform, sometimes tight.     | **Frutiger/Humanist.** Open, varied, friendly.                     |
| **Text Density**          | Standard text size (14-16px), tighter leading (1.4). Efficient. | **Generous.** Large text (18-21px), loose leading (1.6+). Relaxed. |
| **Grid Philosophy**       | **Strict.** The grid dictates the content.                      | **Flexible.** The content dictates the grid.                       |
| **Color**                 | Often stark Black & White or Primary Colors.                    | Warm neutrals, creams, off-blacks, and earth tones.                |
| **Goal**                  | To organize information logically.                              | To make reading a pleasurable, fatigue-free experience.            |

**Summary:** If Swiss Design is a sterile, perfectly organized laboratory, Humanist Modernism is a
well-lit, comfortable library with a comfortable chair.
