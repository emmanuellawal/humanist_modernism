**Date Completed:** November 11, 2025  
**Time Spent:** ~1 hour (as per workflow)  
**Next Phase:** Phase 3 - Sprint Planning (30 minutes)

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. Style Guide Research

- ✅ Read and analyzed Humanist Modernism guide
- ✅ Identified key characteristics:
  - Warm, organic letterforms
  - Clear hierarchy without rigidity
  - Balance of form and function
  - Human-centered approach
- ✅ Distinguished from Swiss design:
  - Less geometric, more organic
  - Warmer personality
  - Greater flexibility in layout

### 2. Reference Collection

- ✅ Analyzed authentic Humanist Modernism examples
- ✅ Studied key practitioners:
  - Adrian Frutiger (typeface design)
  - Erik Spiekermann (meta design)
  - Matthew Carter (screen optimization)
- ✅ Documented sources in style guide

### 3. Initial Mockup Generation

- ✅ AI-generated complete website structure
- ✅ Implemented 6 pages (homepage, about, timeline, designers, blog, 404)
- ✅ Created blog with 3 articles
- ✅ Set up navigation and footer components
- ✅ Applied initial typography and color system
- ✅ Made responsive for mobile/tablet/desktop

### Initial Mockup Preserved

Location: `/research/initial-mockup/`

**What's included:**

- All source files exactly as they are now
- Configuration files for reference
- Built site snapshot for visual comparison
- Comprehensive README documenting current state

**Why preserved:**

- Baseline for iteration comparison
- Track improvements through Sprints 1-3
- Document for collaboration story
- Show "before/after" transformation

---

## 🎯 Current Website State

### Pages Implemented (6)

1. **Homepage** - Hero, featured designers, principles
2. **About** - Humanist Modernism explanation
3. **Timeline** - Historical evolution 1950s-2020s
4. **Designers** - Three practitioner profiles
5. **Blog Index** - Three article listings
6. **404 Page** - Custom error page

### Blog Posts (3)

1. Historical Context
2. Design Principles
3. Modern Application

### Design System Applied

- **Typography:** Inter font family (humanist sans-serif)
- **Colors:** Slate tones + Emerald accent
- **Layout:** Clean grid, generous whitespace, max-width 1280px
- **Components:** Navigation, cards, footer, buttons

### Quality Metrics

- ✅ Build time: 0.66 seconds
- ✅ 9 pages generated
- ✅ 0 build errors
- ✅ All quality gates passing
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks working
- ✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ CSS rendering correctly
- ✅ All navigation links working

---

## 🔄 Phase 2 Status: Content Building

**Note:** Phase 2 (Context Building) was integrated with Phase 1. The three required content pages
were created during the initial mockup generation:

- ✅ Timeline page (historical evolution)
- ✅ Designer profiles (key practitioners)
- ✅ About/Style explanation (core principles)

All content is authentic and based on the Humanist Modernism guide.

## ➡️ Next: Phase 3 - Sprint Planning (30 min)

### Goal

Break iterative work into 3 manageable sprints with clear success criteria.

### Tasks to Complete

1. **Define Sprint 1: Foundation** (10 min)
   - Layout refinement goals
   - Typography enhancement targets
   - Color harmony improvements
   - Desktop excellence criteria

2. **Define Sprint 2: Components** (10 min)
   - Navigation enhancement goals
   - Card/content block improvements
   - Button/link refinements
   - Footer polish targets
   - Mobile responsiveness criteria

3. **Define Sprint 3: Polish** (10 min)
   - Final page completion goals
   - Responsive optimization targets
   - Lighthouse 90+ requirements
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Quality assurance checklist

### Deliverable

Create `/docs/sprint-plan.md` with:

- Specific goals for each sprint
- Clear success criteria
- Time estimates (2 hours per sprint)
- Iteration checkpoints

---

## 📸 Screenshots to Take During Iterations

As you work through Sprints 1-3, take screenshots:

### Before Each Sprint

- Desktop view (1440px)
- Tablet view (768px)
- Mobile view (375px)

### After Each Iteration (2-3x per sprint)

- Same views as above
- Compare to reference images
- Compare to previous iteration
- Note what improved/needs work

### After Each Sprint Complete

- All pages, all viewports
- Lighthouse scores
- Component details
- For collaboration story

---

## 💡 Key Learnings from Phase 1

### What Worked Well

- AI understood Humanist Modernism principles
- Clean separation of concerns (components, layouts)
- Eleventy build system efficient
- Quality gates prevent mistakes
- Pre-commit hooks enforce standards

### What to Improve in Sprints

- Typography needs more humanist warmth
- Layout could be more organic/less rigid
- Component interactions need refinement
- Mobile experience needs attention
- Performance optimization (Lighthouse 90+)
- Accessibility enhancements

### Important Notes

- First version is never good enough (iterate 2-3x minimum)
- Screenshot everything for comparison
- Compare constantly to reference images
- Stop AI when it goes wrong (ESC, CMD+Z)
- Document time spent accurately

## ⏱️ Time Tracking

**Phase 1: Research & Vision**

- Actual time: ~1 hour
- Status: ✅ Complete
- On schedule: ✅ Yes

**Phase 2: Context Building**

- Integrated with Phase 1
- Status: ✅ Complete

**Total elapsed:** ~1 hour  
**Remaining:** ~9 hours (Planning: 0.5h, Build: 6h, Reflection: 1.5h)

---

## 🎓 Portfolio Narrative Notes

**For collaboration story:**

- Started with comprehensive style guide research
- AI generated initial mockup with authentic content
- Created 6 pages + 3 blog posts in first iteration
- Established quality gates (Prettier, ESLint, Stylelint, Husky)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with Lighthouse testing
- Preserved baseline for iteration comparison
- Ready to iterate toward excellence

**Key decision:** Preserving initial mockup allows clear demonstration of iterative improvement
process - a core skill in professional development.
